# CompressGraph

## 1. Description
This is the open-source implementation for CompressGraph:

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 System Dependency
 - [CMake](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake)
 - Optional(CPU): [Ligra](https://github.com/jshun/ligra.git)
 - Optional(GPU): [Gunrock](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock.git)

### 2.2 Compilation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZhengChenCS/CompressGraph.git --recursive
cd CompressGraph
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

### 2.3 Graph Input Format

The initial input graph format should be in the [adjacency graph format](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pbbs/benchmarks/graphIO.html). For example, the SNAP format(edgelist) and the adjacency graph format for a sample graph are shown below.

SNAP format:

```
src dst
0 1
0 2
2 0
2 1
```

Adjacency Graph format:

```
AdjacencyGraph
3 <The number of vertices>
4 <The number of edges>
0 <o0>
2 <o1>
2 <o2>
1 <e0>
2 <e1>
0 <e2>
1 <e3>
```

## 3. CompressGraph Compression

The Compression Mudule accepts binary CSR(Compressed Sparse Row) graph data as input. The `dataset` folder provides an example.

To compress a input graph, run:
```shell
compress <csr_vlist.bin> <csr_elist.bin>
```

To filter the rule by the threshold(16 by default), run:
```shell
filter <csr_vlist.bin> <csr_elist.bin> <info.bin> 16
```

The `script` folder provides the example of invoke compression and filtering.

## 4. ComprassGraph analytics on CPU

CompressGraph implements multi-core parallel graph analytics on CPU based on [Ligra](https://github.com/jshun/ligra.git).

## 5. CompressGraph analytics on GPU

CompressGraph implements multi-core parallel graph analytics on CPU based on [Gunrock](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock.git).
