## 1. Description
This is the open-source implementation for CompressGraph:

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 System Dependency
 - [CMake](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake)
 - OpenMP and C++17
 - Optional(CPU): [Ligra](https://github.com/jshun/ligra.git)
 - Optional(GPU): [Gunrock](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock.git)

### 2.2 Compilation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ZhengChenCS/CompressGraph.git --recursive
cd CompressGraph
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DLIGRA=ON -DGUNROCK=ON
make -j
```

### 2.3 Graph Input Format

The initial input graph format should be in the [adjacency graph format](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pbbs/benchmarks/graphIO.html). For example, the SNAP format(edgelist) and the adjacency graph format for a sample graph are shown below.

SNAP format:

```
src dst
0 1
0 2
2 0
2 1
```

Adjacency Graph format:

```
AdjacencyGraph
3 <The number of vertices>
4 <The number of edges>
0 <o0>
2 <o1>
2 <o2>
1 <e0>
2 <e1>
0 <e2>
1 <e3>
```

## 3. CompressGraph Compression

### 3.1 Data Preparation

The Compression Mudule accepts binary CSR(Compressed Sparse Row) graph data as input, which contains a `vlist` and a `elist` array. 
We provide two programs for converting graph files from edgelist and adjacency graph format to CSR format.
User can invoke them as follows:

* Edgelist to CSR 
```shell
edgelist2csr < <edgelist.txt>
```

* Adjacency graph to CSR
```shell
adj2csr < <adjgraph.txt>
```

The two programs will generate two output files in CSR format: `csr_vlist.bin` and `csr_elist.bin` in the current directory.

### 3.2 Graph Compression 

The `dataset` folder provides an example.

To compress a input graph, run:
```shell
compress <csr_vlist.bin> <csr_elist.bin>
```

To filter the rule by the threshold(16 by default), run:
```shell
filter <csr_vlist.bin> <csr_elist.bin> <info.bin> 16
```

The filter program will filter out rules that meet `(freq - 1) * (len - 1) - 1 <= threshold;`, where `freq` is the frequency of rules, `len` is the length of rules.



The `script` folder provides the example of invoke compression and filtering.

## 4. ComprassGraph Analytics

We have implemented the CompressGraph analytic engine based on [Ligra](https://github.com/jshun/ligra.git) on CPU.

### 4.1 Data Prepareation

Before running the graph analytic program, we need to convert the CSR format to the format required by Ligra.
Additionaly, we generate some auxiliary structures, including `order.bin` and `degree.bin`(used in `pagerank` and `hits`).

```shell
$convert2ligra $csr_vlist $csr_elist > $output
$save_degree $csr_vlist
$gene_rule_order $csr_vlist $csr_elist $info
```

We provide a script `data_prepare.sh` to execute the data prepareation process in `script` directory.

### 4.2 Run Applications

Users can execute graph applications using the following approach:

```shell
./bfs_cpu -r 1 $file
./cc_cpu $file
./sssp_cpu -r 1 $file
./pagerank_cpu -maxiters 10 -i $info -d $degree -o $order $file
./topo_cpu -i $info $file
./hits_cpu -maxiters 10 -i $info -o $order $file
```

We provide scripts in `script/cpu` directory to execute these programs.

### 4.3 Run applications with script

```shell
cd script
bash data_prepare.sh
cd cpu
bash bfs.sh
bash sssp.sh
bash cc.sh
bash pagerank.sh
bash topo.sh
bash hits.sh
```
