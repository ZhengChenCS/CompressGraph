## System Dependency
 - [CMake](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake)
 - Optional(CPU): [Ligra](https://github.com/jshun/ligra.git)
 - Optional(GPU): [Gunrock](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock.git)

 ## Compilation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZhengChenCS/CompressGraph.git --recursive
cd CompressGraph
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

## Graph Compression

The Compression Mudule accepts binary CSR(Compressed Sparse Row) graph data as input. The `dataset` folder provides an example.

To compress a input graph, run:
```shell
compress <csr_vlist.bin> <csr_elist.bin>
```

To filter the rule by the threshold(16 by default), run:
```shell
filter <csr_vlist.bin> <csr_elist.bin> <info.bin> 16
```

The `script` folder provides the example of invoke compression and filtering.

## Graph analytics on CPU

CompressGraph implements multi-core parallel graph analytics on CPU based on [Ligra](https://github.com/jshun/ligra.git).

## Graph analytics on GPU

CompressGraph implements multi-core parallel graph analytics on CPU based on [Gunrock](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock.git).
